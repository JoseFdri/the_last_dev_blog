## $ whoami

**My purpose for coding is simple: to make exceptional products.**

I'm a software engineer specializing in **developer productivity** and tooling. I believe that a happy developer makes a better product, so I focus on architecting the systems that **remove friction** and allow engineering teams to deliver high-quality features, faster.

My background spans **full-stack development, AWS infrastructure**, and leading projects from concept to production. I've established engineering standards, championed practices like trunk-based development, and mentored teamsâ€”all with a single goal: making it incredibly easy for developers to ship great products.

**I see myself as a force multiplier.** By improving the developer experience, I accelerate the entire organization and ensure our collective energy goes into what matters most: **creating value for the end user.**
